This repository contains scripts to convert spherical panoramas to hemispherical images either via command line with [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) or via GUI in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) with batch process in [BIMP](https://alessandrofrancesconi.it/projects/bimp/).

Hemispherical images can then be used to estimate canopy structure and light metrics. I used [Gap Light Analyzer](https://www.caryinstitute.org/science/our-scientists/dr-charles-d-canham/gap-light-analyzer-gla) in the study and provide AutoHotKey scripts to automate the GLA GUI.

Finally, this repo included R scripts used in the analysis and figure creation for the manuscript.

Iâ€™m happy to provide raw spherical images or processed hemispheres upon request, but the entire image dataset is too large to include here.
