These data were generated by running the analyze particle tool in ImageJ on the binary images output by the Hemispherical2.0 plugin.

Only the standard DSLR with no exposure adjustment and only the full resolution images with contrast adjustment were included.
Binary images were inverted before running particle analysis.

The particle analysis 'Results' datasets contain information for every gap in the images. The 'Summary' dataset is the aggregated data for each image.
